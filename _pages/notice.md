* **[2024-12-23]** We have updated the [`Rules`](/urgent2025/rules) page to clarify the policy regarding the use of pre-trained speech enhancement models. **Using pre-trained speech enhancement models trained on data other than the official Challenge dataset is NOT allowed**. Refer to [`Rules`](/urgent2025/rules) page for more details.

* **[2024-12-23]** To accommodate the short challenge period, we have decided to extend the challegnge period for one week.

Please refer to [`Timeline`](/urgent2025/timeline) page for more details.
